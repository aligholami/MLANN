\chapter{Future Work}
We admit the possible drawbacks and inefficiencies existing in this project, thus we have the following key improvement to-do list:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improvement and optimization of Python implementation of MLANN algorithm.
	\item Using newer trained models like \textit{Resnet-V2} for the feature extraction phase.
	\item Implementation of \textit{face alignment} module under \textit{MTCNN-Detect} using parallel programming languages; i.e. CUDA.
	\item Implementation of the \textit{Pivot-based} improvement to the MLANN method for faster face recognition times.
	\item Using one-shot learning to reduce the per-person number of reference images in LFW dataset.
\end{itemize}
