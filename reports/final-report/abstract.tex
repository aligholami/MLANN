Image recognition is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision. Modern face recognition which is one of the substantial subtasks of the image recognition, in most cases, uses \textit{brute-force} nearest neighbor method to iterate through the reference faces database to find the desired identity of the input image. Nowadays, most of these methods extract feature maps of the images using Convolutional Neural Networks. In this project, we'll be using Convolutional Neural Networks to extract image feature maps. We'll also analyze the implementation process of the \textit{Approximate Nearest Neighbor} method to find the best ID for the input image.
